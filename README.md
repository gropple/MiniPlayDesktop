# MiniPlay Desktop
This is the desktop component of MiniPlay, which lets you control Google Play Music without hunting around for the right browser tab.  

## Getting Started
At the moment this is very much just-for-developers.  I'll get this cleaned up and put onto the Chrome extensions store at some point.  Until then:
* Clone this project
* Load the SBT-based project in IntelliJ or similar
* Build the project.  It will pull in all dependencies automatically and should build easily
* Run Application.main()

You'll also need the [the Chrome extension](https://github.com/gropple/MiniPlayChrome).
